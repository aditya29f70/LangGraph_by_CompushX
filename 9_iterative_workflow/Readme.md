## iterative workflow -> where we run roop between two nodes until we don't get our goal or in order to improve something

* workflow is more about building a system which will help us to post about a topic on diff platform

* so you will give a topic -> it will generate a post -> and push that post to any platform

* question is -> how do we evaluate that this post is a quality post -> i have seen that in most of the time first outcome of the llm is not more satisfaction , we ask 2> times it evaluate things

* so in evaluate step we have to give a strick rule about post ;; as highly describe things in evaluation as much it will evaluate things

* after evaluation if it feels like improvement we send things to optimizer with some feedback which is also a llm , and there also we have provided an strick guide line

## now time to implement in code

* after doing that we will try to main the history so we can see all intermediate tweet and it's feedback
