## Goal
1. Why LangGraph exists? (why we can't add those things in langChain to build agentic model)
2. What is LangGraph?
3. LangChain vs LangGraph (when to use what)

* imp thing about langChain is langchain has **Chain** concept;

* What you can build using LangChain
1. Simple conversation workflows like Chatbots, Text Summarizers

2. Multistep workflow

3. RAG application

4. Basic level agents

## now we take some complex workflow (automated hiring , which we have disscussed before) and try to things why LangGraph;; first try to build it using langChain and analys what exactly problems are there

* see the **pic-1** working flow of hiring manager agentic ai

* this workflow is not agentic ai application (sir told) instead it is a workflow


* now what is diff bw Agentic ai applicaiton and workflow you have to go **Anthropic blogs** and try to read this blog **Building effective agents** 

* **WorkFlows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated (at which step, which tool has to be called) through predefined code paths

* **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems when LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
