## Curriculumn: (we will do it by diving it in some modules)
1. Foundation of Agentic ai (learn some diff terms in langGraph) , top frame work from which we can build strong agentic model

2. LangGraph Fundamentals (state, nodes, edges, conditional edges, looping, etc ) and try to build some ai workflows (finally)

3. Advanced LangGraph (persistance, memory, human in the loop, break point , check point, time travel)

4. start building **Ai agent**, start with ReAct Agent, Reflection Design pattern, self ask with help, planning, multi-agent system
