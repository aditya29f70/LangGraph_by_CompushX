# Will learn how to make sequencial workflow in langGraph

-> see basic code how to write in langGraph
-> so after that we can build any kind of sequencial workflow

- now first we have to install the langGraph

## we will use jupyter notebook --> bz by using jupyter notebook we can draw the graph of langGraph

## First workflow (not llm workflow) simple workflow --> bmi calculater workflow

- we will send input(as height+ weight) --> send to a node (where we will calculate bmi) --> output (result)

- since we will do it by langgraph so for that we will draw graph for that ;; and have to define **state**
- three key-value pairs will be in our state --> weight, height, bmi
