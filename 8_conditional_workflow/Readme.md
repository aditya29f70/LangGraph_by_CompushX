## conditional Workflow
* it feels like parallel workflow;; there is diff in execuation
* it has branches like parallel workflow but you don't run all the branches -> you move it only one single branch

* so you will have conditions and those conditions will decide at which brnach you have to move -> lly like **if/else** conditional programming

* you will use it most of the time when you will go to build complex workflow 

* so we will see two workflows for understanding this
* 1. Non llm workflow -> simple math problem workflow -> after that you will concepturly understand how it works
* 2. LLm based workflow -> we will build a customer support related workflow


##  1. Non linear workflow -> Quadratic equation workflow
* so we will make a workflow which will solve a quadratic equation
* quadratic equation -> ax^2 + bx + c=0 ;; need to find it's roots or solution (we will have 2 roots)

* so for finding roots first we find -> 1. discriminant (d= b^2-4*a*c);; and it decide the quality of roots
* if d>0 (two real roots) ;; if d=0 (two equal roots)  ;; if d<0 (unreal roots)

* roots= (-b+ (d)^1/2)/2a and (-b-(d)^1/2)/2a
